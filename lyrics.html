        <h2>MKTO - Classic</h2>
        <pre style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.6rem;">Hey, where's the drums?
Woo oh
Let's go!

Woo, girl, you're shining
Like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never going out of style

Woo, pretty baby
This world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me
When I just wanna make you smile

I wanna thrill you like Michael
I want to kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

You' re over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic (yeah, yeah; gone plastic)
Baby, you're so classic (yeah, yeah)
Baby, you
Baby, you're so classic

Four dozen roses
Anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you
Doing in Sinatra style

I'ma pick you up in a Cadillac
Like a gentleman, bringin' glamour back
Keep it real to real in the way I feel
I could walk you down the aisle

I wanna thrill you like Michael
I want to kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

You' re over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's like a rewind, everything is so <a href="vocab.html">throwback-ish</a>
I kinda like it, like it

Out of my league, old school chic
Like a moviestar from a silver screen
You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic (yeah, yeah)
Baby, you're so classic (so classic; yeah, yeah)
Baby, you're so classic

Baby you're classy, and, baby, you're sick
I never met a girl like you ever 'til we met
A star in the 40s, centerfold in the 50s'
Got met trippin' out like the 60s, hippies

Queen of the discotheque
A 70s dream and a 80s best
Hepburn, Beyoncé, Marilyn, Massey
Girl, you're timeless
Just so classic!

You' re over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's like a rewind, everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it, like it

Out of my league, old school chic
Like a moviestar from a silver screen
You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic (whoa, oh)
Baby, you're so classic (yeah, yeah)
Baby, you're so classic
Ooh</pre>

        <h2>The Neighbourhood - Sweater Wheater</h2>
        <pre style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.6rem;">All I am is a man
            I want the world in my hands
            I hate the beach, but I stand 
            In California, with my toes in the sand
            
            Use the sleeves of my sweater
            Let's have an adventure
            Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
            Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
            You in those little high waisted shorts, oh
            
            She knows what I think about
            And what I think about
            One love, two mouths
            One love, one house
            No shirt, no blouse
            Just us, you find out
            Nothing that wouldn't wanna tell you about no
            
            'Cause it's too cold
            For you here and now
            So let me hold
            Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
            
            And if I may just take your breath away
            I don't mind if there's not much to say
            Sometimes the silence guides our minds 
            To move to a place so far away
            
            The goosebumps start to raise
            The minute that my left hand meets your waist
            And then I watch your face
            Put my finger on your tongue, 'cause you love to taste, yeah
            
            These hearts adore
            Everyone the other beats hardest for
            Inside, this place is warm
            Outside, it starts to pour
            
            Coming down
            One love, two mouths
            One love, one house
            No shirt, no blouse
            Just us, you find out
            Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
            
            'Cause it's too cold

            For you here and now
            So let me hold
            Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, ooh, ooh
            
            'Cause it's too cold
            For you here and now
            So let me hold

            Laisse-moi le temps, j'vais réparer
            À deux, ça le fait mieux, toi et moi, c'est le feu mais te suivre, c'est dangereux (eh)

            Nightcrawlin' in the Phantom (skrrt, skrrt)

            [Kodak Black]
            Pull up in a Demon, on God (on God)
            Lookin' like I still do fraud (fraud)

            In a Hellcat 'cause I'm a hell-raiser
            Self-made, I don't owe a nigga nann favor
            When you get that money, nigga, keep your heart
            I'm slidin' in a coupe, ain't got no key to start
            I got the fire on me in BET Awards
            When your well run dry, you know you need me for it
            When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doin'
            If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'
            Sleepin' on the palette turned me to a savage
            I'm a project baby, now I stay in Calabasas
            Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jackin'
            I be sippin' on lean, tryna keep balance
            Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks
            I don't say much, I just let the heat talk
            Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock
            My lil' baby ride the dick like a seesaw
            When I stepped up on the scene, I was on a bean
            When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Celine
            Baby girl you just a fling, that ain't what I mean
            Money bustin' out my jeans like I do the scheme
            
            Pull up in a demon, on God (on God)
            Lookin' like I still do fraud (fraud)
            Flyin' private jet with the rod (rod)
            This that Z shit, this that Z shit (this that Z shit)
            Pull up in a Demon, on God (on God)
            Lookin' like I still do fraud (fraud)
            Flyin' private jet with the rod (rod)
            This that Z shit, this that Z shit (this that Z shit)
            
            Uh-huh, ha, oh-ah-oh
            Uh-huh, ha, oh-ah-oh

            They're rotting my brain, love
            These hoes are the same
            
            I admit it, another hoe got me finished
            Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
            Fuck sippin', I'mma down a whole bottle
            Hard liquor, hard truth can't swallow
            Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
            Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
            With a new woman
            Tell me she from Colorado
            And she love women
            She'll be gone by tomorrow
            Who am I kiddin'
            All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
            I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
            I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
            Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
            Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
            Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
            Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'
            
            Hey, these girls are the same
            All girls are the same
            They're rotting my brain, love
            Think I need a change
            Before I go insane, love
            All girls are the same
            They're rotting my brain, love
            Think I need a change
            Before I go insane, love
            
            Ten minutes, she tell me it would take ten minutes
            To break my heart, oh no she didn't
            Fuck living, Imma drown in my sorrow
            Fuck giving, Imma take not borrow
            And I'm still sinnin'
            I'm still losing my mind
            I know I been trippin'
            I'm still wasting my time
            All the time given, am I dying, am I living
            It's fuck feelin's, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'
            
            Now I am insane
            Demons in my brain, love
            Peace I can't obtain
            Cause all these girls the same, love
            Now I am insane
            Demons in my brain, love

        <h2>Rainbow Kitten Surprise - It's Called: Freefall</h2>
        <pre style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.6rem;">Called to the Devil and the Devil did come
            I said to the Devil: Devil, do you like drums?
            Do you like cigarettes, dominoes, rum?
            He said: Only sundown, Sundays, Christmas
            
            Some day's end, when I need a few friends
            Now and again, I could never hope to keep them
            Thought to give friends what I thought that they wanted
            Never had they needed a good friend as I've been
            
            Don't get me venting on friends who resent you
            'Cause all you've ever done is been a noose to hang on to
            They thought was a necklace and, reckless
            They fell into hell where you both hang with nothing to do but
            
            Scratch, kick, let gravity win, like
            Fuck this, let gravity win, like
            You could leave it all behind
            Even the Devil needs time alone sometimes
            
            You could let it all go
            You could let it all go
            It's called freefall
            It's called freefall
            
            Called to the Devil and the Devil said: Quit
            Can't be bothered, better handle your shit
            Keep about your wits, man, keep about your wits
            Know yourself and who you came in with
            
            Can I sit down? I've been hustling all day
            I can't even count how many souls I've made
            Off the same deal you on
            Remember: The Devil ain't a friend to no one
            But fun, true
            
            You could let it all go
            You could let it all go
            It's called freefall
            It's called freefall
            
            Called to the Devil and the Devil said: Hey
            Why you've been calling this late?
            It's like 2 AM and the bars all close at 10 in hell
            That's a rule I made
            
            Anyway, you say you're too busy saving everybody else
            To save yourself
            And you don't want no help, oh, well
            That's the story to tell, like
            
            You could let it all go
            You could let it all go
            It's called freefall
            It's called freefall
            
            You could let it all go
            You could let it all go
            'Cause ain't shit free but falling out
            And that shit's easy, let me show you how, it's like
            
            Ain't shit free but falling out
