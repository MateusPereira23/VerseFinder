        <pre>Oh, I leave quite an impression
            Five feet, to be exact
            You're wonderin' why half his clothes went missin'
            My body's where they're at
            
            Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
            Next to me, one degree of separation
            
            I heard you're back together and if that's true
            You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
            If you want forever, and I bet you do
            Just know you'll taste me too
            
            Uh-huh
            
            He pins you down on the carpet
            Makes paintings with his tongue (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
            He's funny, now all his jokes hit different
            Guess who he learned that from?
            
            Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
            Next to me, one degree of separation
            
            I heard you're back together and if that's true
            You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you

            Every time you close your eyes
            And feel his lips, you're feelin' mine
            And every time you breathe his air
            Just know I was already there
            You can have him if you like
            I've been there, done that once or twice
            And singin' 'bout it don't mean I care
            Yeah, I know I've been known to share
            
            Well, I heard you're back together and if that's true
            You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
            If you want forever, and I bet you do (I bet you do)
            Just know you'll taste me too (taste me too, ow)
